# bitpanda-test-assignment

Hi, this is my implementation of the test assignment app. I tried to keep the app light and fulfill all conditions.

## About the app:
 - deployment target iOS 13.0
 - used Swift Package Manager as a 3d-party dependency manager and for local modules
 - used Combine
 - third-party dependencies: 
    - SVGKit for rendering SVG images
    - PINCache for caching SVG data responses

### Linting code
```shell
$ make lint
```

### Formatting code
```shell
$ make format
```
